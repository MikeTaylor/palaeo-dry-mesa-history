Subject: hello, and opportunity to share

Dear Mike and Matt –

I may have corresponded with the two of you at some point, but can’t recall when exactly.  Anyway, I’ve been a closet fan of SVPOW for years.   I also have a particular interest in the Dry Mesa Dinosaur quarry sauropods.  All of these objects are obviously housed and cared for (and loaned) by BYU, but they are from National Forest System lands – and thus federal property.  The point of my post is not to ‘big brother’ BYU (Brooks and Rod are great).   Rather, to share a bit of info that may prove helpful.

See attached [20181003_084746.jpg] – there is a wonderful cast of the BYU [12962: original email said 9025 but see below] Supersaurus scapula (Scap B) on display in the FS main office, Washington DC.  I have a buddy in the DC office.  If you would like, I could arrange to have it spun around and photogrammetrically snapped.

Best, Bruce

Hi, Bruce, great to hear from you. Your name is familiar, and I see you've commented a couple of times on SV-POW! posts. It's interesting to know that the NFS owns the fossils — I'd never really thought about that before. It leaves me now wondering who the ultimate owners are of other important specimens.

It's good to see that cast of Scap B: as with the Scap A cast at the Dinosaur Journey museum, it actually looks more convincing than the real bone does. A good cast can, unfortunately, have that effect! Why do you call it BYU 9025? I am still not 100% certain of the identification of the two scaps, but my sense is that the balance of evidence points to this one as being BYU 12962. Did you receive it with a specimen number?

Mike, sorry, it’s BYU 12962.  Last thing I want to do is create more confusion within this confusion J  Apologies.   Out of curiosity, I’m having our DC office measure overall length of the Dry Mesa ‘Scap B’ replica on display.

Regarding ownership – the Dry Mesa quarry is on US federal land, so technically federal property (both the land, and the fossils).  However I prefer to say that federal fossils are property of “the People of the US”.  I want the public to stay connected to this place and these dinosaurs (makes great internal ammunition for my program).  Recently, we produced an educational activity book on the Dry Mesa quarry (high level elementary audience in mind).  We’re in the process of publishing this online.

And you’re right – good casts are often more aesthetic and skew perspective.  But not always bad I don’t think.  Sometimes it actually makes the fossil easier to interpret, certainly easier to study (example attached of an unpublished ‘Apatosaurus’ shoulder blades (both right and left almost certainly from same individual, in collections of Denver Museum).  As you can see, my crew also developed the same condition as Jensen – they could not see a scap-coracoid without lying down in the dirt for a photograph.
