Subject: How to do history

Hi, Martin. This is a bit cheeky, but you're the only person I know who works in the humanities, so ...

I am working on a project that is largely about the history of a bit of recentish science (1970s and 1980s). I'm hoping to interview some of the surviving players in the episode in question. Do you know if there are  established guidelines for how such interviews should be conducted, or advice on how to do them well?

Or, failing that, do you know a historian who could guide me?

Thanks!

-- Mike.

Hi Mike,

Thanks so much for this... The subject line amused me!

OK, so this is a complex subject and I think it's right that you get some advice on this. I don't, personally, conduct such interviews so can only offer partial information but:

1. You need to have a consent form for human participation in research, including the right to withdraw that consent at any time and conditions of anonymity;

2. You need to run it past an ethics review board if there is any university involvement;

3. People need to be able to check their interviews;

I would recommend that you ask whether Bristol has any training programmes (usually for Ph.D. students) on interview processes and ethics. Failing that, Aileen Fyfe <akf@st-andrews.ac.uk> at St Andrews -- a great historian of science -- might have some further guidance than I can give...

Hope that helps a bit...

Best wishes,

Martin
