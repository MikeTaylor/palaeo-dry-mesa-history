p171: "Only a few bones of this creature have been dug out so far -- but these include a pair of shoulder blades eight feet long as well as neck vertebrae nearly five feet long."

Earliest record of Scap A (later BYU 9025, the holotype).

BYU 9024 is 138 cm long, which is four and a half feet, so "nearly five feet long" is slight exaggeration.

"These measurements are 20 percent larger than in a any previous find. The bones are from a huge, herbivorous animal that may have towered to 50 feet and weighed perhaps a hundred tons -- _if_ its anatomical design resembled that of _Brachiosaurus_ or other more completely known relatives."

"The team in Jim's Dry Mesa quarry was quick to call this animal by the unoffical name of "Supersaurus". It may have been as much as one-fifth larger than anything else known among the dinosaurs.

(This article gives the height of Brachiosaurus as 40 feet, so the "one fifth larger" is in linear dimension. That should give a mass factor of 1.2^3 = 1.728, which based on the 80 ton mass estimate on p170 should yield an estimate of 138 tons for Supersaurus.)

p176: "If, as seems probable, Supersaurus was a four-footed herbivore built along the lines of _Brachiosaurus_ ..."

So still considered brachiosaurid at this time. I wonder why?
